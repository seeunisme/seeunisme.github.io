          <h1>About this thesis</h1>
          <p class="page-lead">
            I’m exploring how multi-sensory entertainment can feel rich,
            expressive, and joyful for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing people — not as
            an afterthought, but as the starting point.
          </p>

          <h2>Big question</h2>
          <p>
            Most entertainment is built around sound first, and then captions
            are added on top. I’m asking:
          </p>
          <p class="quote-block">
            “What if we designed for vibration, light, motion, and touch from
            the very beginning, not just as ‘accessibility features’?”
          </p>

          <h2>What you’ll see here</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Small experiments and sketches instead of polished products.</li>
            <li>Notes from sessions and playtests (with details anonymized).</li>
            <li>
              Questions I’m stuck on where your perspective can really help.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How your feedback helps</h2>
          <p>
            Your reactions — even a single emoji — help me see what feels
            exciting, confusing, or off. I use this feedback to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose which ideas to keep exploring.</li>
            <li>Notice what feels missing or hard to read.</li>
            <li>Make the final thesis less academic and more human.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who this is for</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing folks (primary focus).</li>
            <li>Friends, interpreters, and collaborators.</li>
            <li>Designers and accessibility advocates curious about this space.</li>
          </ul>
